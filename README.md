#Abstract:

As time goes, there always will be an increase in population and crime rate, hence, crime data will be ever increasing. In a way to accommodate this FBI came up with an efficient way to segregate and maintain the quality of the crime data. NIBRS captures all these details and provides law enforcement agencies with a standardized, electronic blueprint for storing the NIBRS data within their individual records management systems. The goal of NIBRS is to enhance the quantity, quality, and timeliness of crime data collection and to improve the methodology used in compiling, analysing, auditing, and publishing the collected crime statistics. There are two categories of offenses reported in the NIBRS: Group A and Group B. Group A defines violent crimes out of the two. In the crime data, the NIBRS codes are mentioned but they aren’t in any order. The rates of violent crime from NIBRS were on average less than 1% higher than rates from data defined by Summary UCR. NIBRS provides individual records of incidents with details on offense, offender, Victim, and property. With the help of data analysis and all these details we can achieve viable inferences on crime analysis. Number of criteria such as seriousness, frequency, prevalence, probability etc. are used to categorize the crime data into Group A and B.

#Dataset:

The data set provided is crime data of Montgomery County of Mary land. This is an open-source database which can be accessed by the public at any point of time, and it keeps updating every day.

#Scope of Research for the Project:

The main goal of this research is to deeply analyze and understand the trends of this data set and increasing the credibility of the data set by implementing different statistical methods for analyzing and auditing the data set and highlighting the useful crime statistics. The provided data is an ongoing research and is being updated regularly. Initial data analysis and EDA is performed on the data set to answer the research questions.
